# Drupal web.config Sensitive File Disclosure via Apache

## Severity
**Medium** (CVSS 5.3)

## CVE / CWE
- CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
- OpenVAS: "Sensitive File Disclosure (HTTP)" — `/drupal/web.config`

## Description
Metasploitable 3's Drupal installation includes a `web.config` file in the
Drupal root (`/var/www/html/drupal/web.config`). This file is an IIS URL
Rewrite configuration artifact that is bundled with the Drupal distribution for
use on Windows/IIS deployments. On Apache it has no functional role but Apache
serves it as a plain XML file to any client that requests it.

The `web.config` file reveals:
- The internal URL rewrite rules and application routing structure
- PHP file mappings and handler configurations
- Path-disclosure information that aids further enumeration and exploitation

An attacker performing reconnaissance can retrieve this file unauthenticated,
gaining an accurate map of the application's internal URL structure. On some
deployments `web.config` may also contain database connection strings or other
sensitive attributes.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** Apache2 + Drupal 7.31
- **Port:** 80/TCP
- **Path:** `/drupal/web.config`
- **File on disk:** `/var/www/html/drupal/web.config`

## Vulnerable Configuration
Apache has no rule denying access to `.config` extension files:
```
# GET /drupal/web.config -> 200 OK (file served in full)
```
