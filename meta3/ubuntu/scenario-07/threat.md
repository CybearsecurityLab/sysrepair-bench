# ProFTPD 1.3.5 mod_copy Arbitrary File Copy

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 10.0)

## CVE
CVE-2015-3306

## Description
ProFTPD 1.3.5 ships with `mod_copy` enabled by default. The `mod_copy` module
implements the `SITE CPFR` (copy from) and `SITE CPTO` (copy to) FTP commands,
which allow any unauthenticated client to read and write arbitrary files on the
server filesystem. Because ProFTPD runs as root or a service account with broad
filesystem access, an attacker can:

1. Copy `/etc/passwd` or SSH private keys to a web-accessible directory and
   retrieve them over HTTP.
2. Copy a PHP web shell into the web root and execute arbitrary commands.
3. Overwrite critical system files.

No authentication is required. The commands are processed in the pre-authentication
context of the FTP session.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** ProFTPD 1.3.5
- **Port:** 21/TCP
- **Binary:** /opt/proftpd/sbin/proftpd
- **Module:** mod_copy.so

## Proof of Concept
```
nc -n 127.0.0.1 21
# wait for banner, then send:
SITE CPFR /etc/passwd
# expect: 350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
SITE CPTO /tmp/passwd.copy
# expect: 250 Copy successful
```
Any FTP client can issue these commands before authenticating.

## Vulnerable Configuration
ProFTPD 1.3.5 compiled with `--with-modules=mod_copy`. The module is active
by default once compiled in. No `LoadModule` directive is required; the module
is statically linked.

> The running ProFTPD is a **source build under `/opt/proftpd`** (vulnerable 1.3.5), with
> **no dpkg entry** — so `apt-get install proftpd` does not touch it (it would install a
> separate, unused distro package while the vulnerable `/opt` daemon keeps serving).
