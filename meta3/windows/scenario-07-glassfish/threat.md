# Oracle GlassFish 4.1.1 — Admin Traversal + Exposed Admin Listener with Empty Password

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 9.8)

## CVE
- **CVE-2017-1000028** — Unauthenticated directory-traversal (`%c0%ae%c0%ae/`) on the
  admin listener allows arbitrary file read, including `domain.xml` / master-password
  files and ultimately the admin credentials themselves.
- Compounding weakness: **empty admin password** on a plaintext admin listener →
  remote administrative access once traversal or brute-force reveals the realm is unlocked.

## Description
GlassFish 4.1.1 shipped an HTTP handler that decoded overlong UTF-8 byte sequences (e.g.
`%c0%ae` for `.`) **before** the path-normalization check. A single GET request to
`/theme/META-INF/prototype%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/.../<any-file>` on the admin
listener returns the raw contents of that file relative to the `glassfish/domains/`
directory — all without authentication.

This host makes the impact worse by:
- Serving the admin listener over **plaintext HTTP** on `:4848` (secure-admin left
  disabled), so the overlong-UTF-8 traversal probe reaches the admin console directly.
- Leaving the admin realm user (`admin`) with an **empty password** (the keyfile line
  is `admin;;asadmin`), so once traversal discovers the realm configuration — or once an
  attacker simply tries `admin:""` — full administrative access is granted.

This reproduces the configuration baked by upstream Metasploitable3
(`scripts/installs/setup_glassfish.bat` + the bundled `admin-keyfile` / `domain.xml`).

## Affected Service
- **Service:** Oracle GlassFish 4.1.1 (`domain1`)
- **Ports:** 4848/TCP (admin, plaintext HTTP), 8080/TCP (applications)
- **Config:** `C:\glassfish4\glassfish\domains\domain1\config\{domain.xml,admin-keyfile}`

## Vulnerable Configuration
```
# admin-listener served over plaintext HTTP on :4848 (secure-admin NOT enabled),
# so the %c0%ae traversal on /theme/META-INF/ is reachable unauthenticated.
```
```
# admin-keyfile — admin user with an empty password (no hash field)
admin;;asadmin
```
No patched build of GlassFish exists (Oracle discontinued the OSS track); CVE-2017-1000028
is unfixed on the 4.x line.

## Proof
```
# 1. Traversal read of domain.xml
curl --path-as-is \
  "http://<target>:4848/theme/META-INF/prototype%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/domain.xml"

# 2. Log in as admin with an empty password over the secure-admin REST API
curl -u admin: "http://<target>:4848/management/domain"
```

## Constraints
- This is a compensating-control scenario: no fixed GlassFish build exists, and
  decommissioning the server or migrating to another application server is out of
  scope. `domain1` must remain installed at `C:\glassfish4` and keep serving
  applications on port 8080.
- The admin realm's `admin` account must not be removed.
