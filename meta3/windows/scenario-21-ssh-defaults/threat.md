# OpenSSH-Win32 Legacy Build + Default `vagrant:vagrant` Admin Credentials

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 9.8 — unauthenticated-to-root/SYSTEM via guessable creds;
multiple unpatched pre-auth CVEs on the SSH server itself)

## CVE
OpenVAS flagged the following on this host's port 22, all traceable to the same
legacy Win32-OpenSSH 7.1.0.0-p1-beta binary Rapid7 ships:

- **CVE-2016-1908** — OpenSSH unauthenticated X11 forwarding trust bypass.
- **CVE-2016-6210** — OpenSSH user-enumeration via response-time oracle.
- **CVE-2016-6515** — OpenSSH pre-auth DoS via overlong password.
- **CVE-2016-10009 / 10010 / 10011 / 10012** — OpenSSH 7.3 privilege-separation and
  agent-forwarding issues.
- **CVE-2017-15906** — OpenSSH sftp-server read-only bypass (< 7.6).
- **CVE-2018-15473 / 15919** — OpenSSH 7.7 user enumeration.
- Additional user-enumeration and DoS variants up through the 2024/2025 lineage
  that stale Win32-OpenSSH has never received back-ported fixes for.

Independent of the CVEs, the **vagrant / vagrant** local administrator account —
installed by the Rapid7 provisioner and never rotated — grants full interactive and
network logon via this same SSH listener.

## Description
Rapid7's metasploitable3-windows Vagrant build installs the Microsoft
Win32-OpenSSH 7.1.0.0-beta release so Vagrant can drive provisioning. The account
it authenticates with is `vagrant:vagrant`, a local member of
`BUILTIN\Administrators`. Neither the binary nor the password is ever rotated for
the lifetime of the box.

An unauthenticated attacker who can reach port 22 has two independent paths to
SYSTEM-equivalent code execution:
1. `ssh vagrant@<host>` with password `vagrant` — immediate interactive shell as
   local admin; trivial privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` via
   `PsExec -s` or a quick `New-Service` drop.
2. Any of the pre-auth OpenSSH CVEs that a 7.1.0.0-beta build never received a
   patch for — most are DoS/enum, but the overall posture is that of an unsupported
   SSH daemon.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** `sshd` (Win32-OpenSSH 7.1.0.0-p1-beta)
- **Port:** 22/TCP
- **Binary path:** `C:\Program Files\OpenSSH\sshd.exe`
- **Credential:** `vagrant:vagrant` in `Administrators`

## Vulnerable Configuration
```
OpenSSH for Windows version : 7.1.0.0-p1-Beta (released 2015)
vagrant local user          : password = "vagrant", member of Administrators
sshd                        : LISTEN 0.0.0.0:22, password auth enabled
```

## Constraints
- This container has no outbound network access.
