"""Reconstruct the pass@1..pass@k curve from a single k-attempt run.

Why
---
``seeds: [1, 5]`` costs two full evals to produce success@1 and success@5
(``run.py`` loops ``seeds_list`` and calls ``inspect_eval`` once per k). That is
unnecessary: a k-attempt run already records every attempt's outcome, so the
whole curve comes out of one log.

Where the data comes from
-------------------------
Each graded submission calls inspect's ``score()``, which emits a
``ScoreEvent(intermediate=True)`` into the sample transcript
(``inspect_ai/scorer/_score.py``). Those events persist in
``EvalSample.events`` — ``run.py`` never sets ``log_samples``, so they survive
into the ``.eval`` file.

Inspect's react agent breaks *before* grading the final attempt
(``_react.py:261-269``), and every solver in ``solvers.py`` mirrors that, so a
k-attempt run emits exactly **k-1** intermediate events; the k-th attempt's
outcome is the end-of-sample score.

In-episode oracle calls — hivestorm's ``score_progress`` tool, LATS's in-search
verify — use raw ``sandbox().exec()`` and emit no ScoreEvent, so they cannot
inflate the attempt count. That invariant is what makes this reader correct;
see the note in ``solvers.py``.

Extraction rule
---------------
::

    E = intermediate score events, in order   (attempts 1..k-1)
    F = end-of-sample score                   (attempt k, or the only grade)

    pass@j = any(E[:j] passed) or (F passed, if len(E) < j)

The ``len(E) < j`` fallback is load-bearing. A sample halted by
``message_limit``, ``time_limit``, or a dead container never submits and emits
**zero** intermediate events — but a real k=1 run would still have scored it at
end-of-sample, and it may pass. Scoring those as failures biases pass@1
downward. They are not dropped either; that would skew the denominator.

Validity
--------
``attempts`` is never disclosed to the model (referenced only at
``_react.py:173,263,268``; neither the react prompt nor our ``on_continue``
mentions it), so pre-first-submit history is byte-identical between k=1 and
k=5. Attempt j inside a k=5 run is the same random variable as the single
attempt of a k=j run — extraction is exact, not an approximation.

Caveats
-------
- Hivestorm is excluded: it always runs react at k=1 and is scored on a
  continuous 0..1 scale, so it has no pass@k axis.
- LATS gets uncapped ground-truth checks *inside* one attempt, so its pass@1 is
  not on equal footing with react's. Flagged in the output.

    The formula draws k of the n observed attempts at random, so it estimates
    "P(success within k tries)" only when every attempt has the same success
    probability. That holds ACROSS independent episodes (separate seeds, fresh
    container each time) and it is the right estimator there.

    It does NOT hold for the k attempts inside one episode, which is what this
    module reconstructs: the agent sees the verifier's failure feedback between
    attempts, so later attempts are systematically better informed. Measured on
    n=5, k=3, 200k trials:

    uses _prefix_pass_at (below) and this function is kept for the
    across-episode case, where the exchangeability it needs is real.

    This is the estimator the within-episode curve needs. It makes no
    exchangeability assumption -- it simply reads off the process that actually
    happened, so it stays unbiased when feedback makes later attempts better or
    worse than earlier ones (see _chen_pass_at_k for the measured comparison).

    The retry harness STOPS at the first passing attempt, so a solved episode
    records fewer than k outcomes. Such an episode is a *pass* for every k at or
    above its first passing attempt -- it must NOT be dropped at higher k (that
    was a bug that collapsed the k=5 denominator to the few hardest episodes and
    understated pass@k). We therefore key off the first passing attempt:

      * passed at attempt m  -> 1.0 for k>=m, 0.0 for k<m (counted at every k)
      * never passed, >=k attempts observed -> 0.0 (a genuine failure at k)
      * never passed, <k attempts observed  -> UNRESOLVED, see policy below.

    Unresolved (a.k.a. "truncated") episodes
    ----------------------------------------
    These ran out of harness budget -- message_limit, time_limit, working_limit
    -- before making k graded submissions, and never passed. Two policies:

      unresolved="fail" (DEFAULT) -> 0.0. The system did not repair the host
        within the budget it was given, which is a non-solve under the operating
        protocol we actually ran. Keeps the denominator FIXED across k, so no
        denominator drift can hide a collapse.

      unresolved="drop" -> None (the historical behaviour). Treats the outcome as
        unknown. DANGEROUS: truncation correlates with failure (an agent that
        flails burns its budget), so dropping deletes failures and inflates
        pass@k. Measured on a misconfigured 27B black-box run where NO episode
        reached k=5, "drop" reported pass@5 = 100.0% (26/26) against an honest
