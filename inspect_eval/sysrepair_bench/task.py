    Parameters
    ----------
    solver:
        One of: react, basic, reflexion, plan_and_solve, lats.
    benchmarks:
        Subset of ["meta2", "vulnhub", "ccdc"]. Ignored if ``scenarios`` is set.
        Defaults to all three.
    scenarios:
        Explicit scenario paths (relative to repo root, e.g. "meta2/scenario-01")
        or absolute paths. Overrides ``benchmarks``.
    mode:
        ``"day1"`` (default) gives the agent the full threat.md briefing (CVE,
        description, remediation steps).  ``"zero_day"`` withholds the briefing
        — the agent must discover and remediate the vulnerability blind.
        Hivestorm scenarios always use their own free-roam template regardless
        of this setting.
    message_limit:
        Per-sample message budget (the "forced halt" cap on agent turns).
    max_attempts:
        For react/reflexion-style solvers that support resubmission after a
        failed answer.
    time_limit:
        Per-sample wall-clock ceiling in seconds. ``None`` = unlimited. Set this
        on HPC runs to stop a hung scenario from silently burning GPU-hours.
    token_limit:
        Per-sample token ceiling (input + output). ``None`` = unlimited.
    bash_timeout:
        Per-command timeout (seconds) for the bash tool and raw sandbox execs.
        Defaults to 180 — long enough for Hardy-era services (Samba, VNC, Ruby
        dRuby, distccd) to start on first invocation.
    verify_timeout:
        Timeout (seconds) for verify.sh inside the sandbox when solvers run it
        mid-run (reflexion / plan-and-solve / lats).
    request_limit:
        Max API requests per sliding window.  0 = unlimited (no rate limiting).
        Set to match your provider plan (e.g. 15000 for MiniMax Max tier).
    request_window:
        Sliding window size in seconds.  Default 18000 (5 hours) to match
        MiniMax Token Plan windows.
