# Wedge supervisor + completion reporter for all five eval streams.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# A stream can park forever on a half-closed socket: the remote closes, the client
# never does, the first model call never returns, and the process sits in
# CLOSE_WAIT indefinitely. The configured timeouts do NOT save it (all four model_*
# keys set correctly and it still hung), and the harness backstop is
# hang_kill_seconds = max(time_limit*(retry_on_error+2), 1800) = 14400s for our
# presets. A four-hour backstop for a fault detectable in ten minutes is not a
# detector; it is what runs when the detector is missing.
#
# DETECTION (three-signal conjunction; any single term alone is a false positive)
#   1. CPU delta below a THRESHOLD for the tick
#   2. scored-sample count static
#   3. at least one CLOSE_WAIT socket owned by the pid
#
# The CPU term must be a threshold, never exact equality: a blocked process still
# accrues idle-loop CPU, so an equality test never holds and the counter resets
# every tick, reporting a clean state it cannot actually detect.
#
# TWO FIXES over the previous version, both found the hard way:
#  (a) It watched only three streams. The two Qwen-9B legs run against a DELTA
#      TUNNEL, which is precisely the endpoint that can vanish, so they were the
#      ones most needing supervision and were the ones omitted. All five now.
#  (b) The old completion watcher marked a stream permanently "seen" on status
#      =error. After a deliberate kill and relaunch that made it blind to the new
#      run forever. Status is now re-read every tick and only ever reported, never
#      latched, so a relaunched stream is picked up again.
#
# For tunnelled streams the tunnel itself is a term: if :8001 is unreachable the
# 9B legs cannot work regardless of their own state, so that is reported
# separately rather than mistaken for a wedge.
