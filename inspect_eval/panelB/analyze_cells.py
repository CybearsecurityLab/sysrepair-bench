"""Committed analysis entry point: samples cache -> pass@k, clustered CI, variance.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Three gaps, all closed here:

1. **Reproducibility.** ``sysrepair_bench/stats.py`` computes the paper's
   headline intervals but, as committed, has NO production caller -- only
   ``tests/test_stats.py``. The tab:main CIs in ci_values.md were produced by a
   script that never made it into the repo, so a reviewer holding the released
   logs cannot regenerate them. This module is the missing
   ``logs -> Observation -> bootstrap_ci`` path, in git, runnable.

2. **The pass@k estimator.** Uses the same policy as the fixed
   ``passk.py``: success is absorbing, and an episode that never passed and made
   fewer than k graded attempts (budget exhausted) counts as a FAILURE, not a
   drop. Dropping inflates pass@k -- see the defect writeup in
   iclr-2027/experiments/STATUS.md.

3. **Variance decomposition.** Splits observed variance into between-scenario
   and within-scenario (epoch) components, then projects what more EPOCHS versus
   more SCENARIOS would buy. This is the evidence for whether the planned
   10-epoch protocol is worth its 3.3x compute, or whether adding scenarios
   defends the paper better per unit of compute.

Clustering
----------
The unit of inference is the SCENARIO, not the episode. Three epochs of one
scenario are repeated measurements of a single problem instance, not independent
replicates, so each scenario contributes ONE clustered value (its mean over
epochs) exactly as ci_values.md documents. Treating episodes as independent
pseudo-replicates makes intervals far too narrow.
