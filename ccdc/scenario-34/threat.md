# Scenario 34: unattended-upgrades Not Configured

## Vulnerability
The system does not have `unattended-upgrades` installed or configured. Without automatic security updates, the system will accumulate known vulnerabilities over time as patches are released but never applied. This is especially critical for internet-facing servers where timely patching is essential to prevent exploitation of disclosed CVEs.

## CWE Classification
- **CWE-1104**: Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components
- Without automatic updates, installed packages become unmaintained from a security perspective.

## Affected Components
- `unattended-upgrades` package - Not installed
- `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` - Auto-update configuration (missing)
- `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` - Unattended-upgrades configuration (missing)
