# RocketMQ 5.1.0 — Unauthenticated Config RCE (CVE-2023-33246)

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 9.8)

## CVE / CWE
- CVE-2023-33246
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

## Description
Apache RocketMQ 5.1.0 exposes a broker administration port (default 10911)
that accepts `UPDATE_BROKER_CONFIG` commands without any authentication when
ACL is disabled. An attacker with network access to this port can send a
crafted `UPDATE_BROKER_CONFIG` request to modify the broker's `filterServerNums`
and `rocketmqHome` properties. The broker will then start a filter server
process using the attacker-controlled path, achieving unauthenticated remote
code execution as the broker user.

The attack chain:
1. Attacker sends `UPDATE_BROKER_CONFIG` to port 10911 setting
   `filterServerNums=1` and `rocketmqHome=<attacker-controlled-path>`
2. Broker launches a filter server subprocess using the attacker's path
3. Attacker's binary executes as the `rocketmq` process user

No credentials are required. Public PoC scripts exist that automate this
attack in a single command.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** Apache RocketMQ 5.1.0
- **Ports:** 10911/TCP (broker administration), 9876/TCP (NameServer)
- **Vulnerable component:** Broker administration command handler, ACL disabled

## Vulnerable Configuration
- `aclEnable=false` in `broker.conf`
- Port 10911 accessible from untrusted networks
- No iptables rules restricting access to the broker administration port

## Constraints
- The RocketMQ broker and its NameServer on port 9876 must remain operational
  for legitimate clients.
