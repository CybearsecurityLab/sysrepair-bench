# Jenkins CLI Arbitrary File Read (CVE-2024-23897)

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 9.8)

## CVE / CWE
- CVE-2024-23897
- CWE-22: Path Traversal (via args4j `@file` expansion)

## Description
Jenkins uses the `args4j` command-line argument parser, which by default
expands any argument beginning with `@` by reading the referenced file and
splitting its content as additional arguments. The Jenkins CLI never
disabled this behavior, so any CLI command reachable to a user (including
anonymous, if the job is discoverable) can be made to read arbitrary files
from the controller filesystem:

```
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://target:8080 help "@/etc/passwd"
```

Reading `/var/jenkins_home/secrets/master.key` and related secret files
permits offline decryption of stored credentials, which can then be used
to trigger RCE through a configured SSH/agent key or pipeline script.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** Jenkins LTS
- **Port:** 8080/TCP
- **Vulnerable versions:** LTS ≤ 2.426.2, weekly ≤ 2.441
- **Binary:** `/usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war`
