# Dirty Pipe — Linux Pipe Splice Overwrite (CVE-2022-0847)

## Severity
**High** (CVSS 7.8)

## CVE / CWE
- CVE-2022-0847
- CWE-665: Improper Initialization (`PIPE_BUF_FLAG_CAN_MERGE`)

## Description
Linux kernel commit `f6dd975583bd` (v5.8) introduced a `struct pipe_buffer`
flag (`PIPE_BUF_FLAG_CAN_MERGE`) that was not zero-initialized when the
buffer came from `copy_page_to_iter_pipe` or `push_pipe`. An unprivileged
process can splice data from a read-only file into a pipe and then write
to the pipe, causing the kernel to overwrite the page cache of the
original file — bypassing file permissions (including read-only mounts,
SUID root binaries, and bind mounts).

This scenario is **kernel-level**: a container shares its host's kernel.
The container carries the userspace primitives (a SUID root marker file,
PoC reference).

## Affected Service
- **Vulnerable kernels:** Linux 5.8 through 5.16.10 / 5.15.25 / 5.10.102
- **Host kernel is authoritative** (reported by `uname -r`)

## Constraints
- This is a compensating-control scenario: the running kernel belongs to the
  host and cannot be upgraded, replaced, or masked from inside this system.
- The SUID marker binary `/opt/suid-marker` must remain present and functional.
