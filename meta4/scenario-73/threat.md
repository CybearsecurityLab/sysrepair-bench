# Docker Registry 2 — No Authentication (misconfig)

## Severity
**Critical** (CVSS 9.8)

## CVE / CWE
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

## Description
Docker Registry 2 (the reference implementation) ships with authentication
disabled by default. When no `REGISTRY_AUTH` environment variable is set, the
registry's `/v2/` API accepts all requests without credentials. Any client with
network access to port 5000 can:

- **List all images:** `GET /v2/_catalog` returns the full image inventory.
- **Pull any image:** Download proprietary, sensitive, or internal container
  images without authorization.
- **Push malicious images:** Upload backdoored or malware-laden images that
  other systems will then pull and execute.
- **Delete images:** Permanently remove images, causing denial-of-service for
  dependent deployments.

This is a misconfiguration with a critical impact because container images often
contain application source code, internal tooling, configuration, and
credentials embedded in layers.

## Affected Service
- **Service:** Docker Registry v2
- **Port:** 5000/TCP
- **Vulnerable endpoint:** `GET /v2/_catalog` returns 200 without credentials

## Vulnerable Configuration
- Registry started without `REGISTRY_AUTH` environment variable
- `curl http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog` returns HTTP 200
